This repository contains my first probes with FPGA design using Verilog.

All exercuses are targeted to be run on very cheap FPGA development board Tang Nano 9K. This toy cost me 20 euro.

I don't take this activity very seriously, doing it just for fun, out of curiosity, to understand how these things work. Let's see how far I can get with this new hobby.
